# Designed to simplify the reinforcement learning.
# It can do the following:
- simplify the construction of neural networks 
- automatically construct the shadow neural network with NO human efforts.
- simplify the building of the gradient functions
- offer a simple interface to different game environments, e.g., openAI gym, Flappybird.


# Quick Start 
```
python DDPG/DDPG.py 
```
In this example, I implemented the DDPG [1] algorithm and run it against an openAI gym game. 
```
python DQN/DQN.py
```
In this example, I implemented the DQN [2] algorithm and run it against the Flappybird game.
